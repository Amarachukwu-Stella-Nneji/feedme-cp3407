# FeedMe

## Project Overview
FeedMe is a web-based food delivery application developed as part of CP3407/CP5507 Advanced Software Engineering at James Cook University.  
The project is designed as an improved alternative to FoodPanda, focusing on usability, affordability, and better support for small and local food vendors.

The system allows customers to browse restaurants, place food orders, and make online payments through a modern graphical user interface.  
Restaurant owners can manage menus and receive and update orders through an administrative dashboard.
